Royals, at full strength, minus Charlie, started with last weeks Man of the Match and captain for the day, Alex, alongside JJ at the back. Robbie on the right and Jordan on the left made the midfield, with Ben and the in-form Scott up front. Frasier took up his usual position between the posts.<br><br>From the off, a fiercely contested midfield battle broke out, with Robbie often emerging with the ball and looking to play forwards to Ben and Scott. Rushmoor's back line were pacy and well organised, and did very well to break up the threat from Royals lively forwards, and start counter attacks of their own.<br><br>With three minutes on the clock, a throw from Alex was made to be re-taken. Jordan took the ball and threw a perfect ball into space and beyond the Spiders last line of defence. Scott was onto it in a flash and advanced into the penalty area, before firing confidently past the onrushing goalkeeper. Royals had broken the deadlock.<br><br>Shortly after, Robbie brought the ball forward and passed to Jordan, who in turn layed the ball off for Scott on the left. Scott cut inside and fed Ben on the right, who beat one defender and delivered a superb cross which Scott headed narrowly wide. Royals two front men were linking well and Scott had another chance soon after, which came back off the left hand post.<br><br>In between, Rushmoor squandered a great opportunity when a weak finish went wide of the near post after some good build up play. There was still time for Jordan to flash a first half effort across goal, which had the keeper beaten, but failed to find the target.<br><br>The second half saw Jack back on for Alex, and Royals were forced to play deep in their own half, and relying on breakaways. The Rushmoor defence, to their credit, were doing a terrific job restricting the service to Ben and Scott, although Camberley can count themselves a little unlucky not to be awarded a penalty, when Scott's run into the area was ended by what seemed to be a trip, only for the referee to wave play-on.<br><br>Camberley did add a second midway through the half, when Jordan's right wing corner was floated into the near post. The ball had enough pace and swerve on it to evade the home keeper and cross the line. Ben did what all good strikers should, and bundled the ball over the line, but the goal, had already been awarded, and Royals had doubled their lead.<br><br>Scott and Ben were a constant thorn in the side of the Rushmoor defence, and both had further opportunities to add to the scoresheet. Ben with a couple of well stuck efforts narrowly off target, and Scott thwarted by some last ditch defending.<br><br>Rushmoor continued to press forwards, and took up some excellent positions deep into Camberley territory. Alex, Jack and JJ between them formed a solid barrier, restricting Spiders to a handful of opportunities. With only a couple of minutes left on the clock, Camberley's defence was breached, and from their best chance of the game, a close range goalbound shot was palmed out for a corner by Frasier's excellent save.<br><br>Just before the final whistle, at the other end, Ben made a chance for himself with an excellent run down the inside left channel. With the keeper to beat, Ben showed great improvisation to hit a right foot effort towards goal, which unfortunately came back into play via the left hand upright.<br><br>Two games against Rushmoor Community have brought two victories, and two clean sheets. An excellent performance today with everyone working really hard for the team, bringing three well deserved points. Frasier's last minute save further emphasises his valuable contribution to the team. The defence kept chances to a minimum, but need to work hard on getting back to cover if they are beaten for pace. Robbie and Jordan between them worked tirelessly in the middle of the park, and the front two forged a great understanding and awareness, which makes them a danger to any team. Scott continued his fine excellent form, and was deservedly awarded Camberley's Man of the Match.<br>Whilst writing this report, I cannot comment on our final league position, although I sincerely hope that this result, and our performances this season, will be enough to see us rewarded with a higher grade of football for 2008/9. Let me sign off by thanking all of you who have made contributions towards a thoroughly entertaining season, and say a special big thank you to all the players for their efforts. Let's see if we can all build on our success during the forthcoming tournaments and carry this forwards into the new season.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>20/04/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 3 Hook United Pumas 3<br><br>After another three week wait for a fixture, Royals last home league match of the season saw them take on Hook United Pumas at Heatherside. With the league looking very tight at the top going into the final games, Camberley would have to work exceptionally hard against an improving Pumas side if they were to come away with any much needed league points.<br><br>Camberley, at full strength, started brightly, with Jordan and Ben both going close in the opening minute, and they didn't have to wait too long for the opener, a fine strike from Jordan's trusty left boot - his 20th of the season.<br><br>As in the two sides earlier league encounter, the game ebbed and flowed with both sides mounting attacks. Hook relying on their wide men to pressurise the home defence, and Royals forcing a number of corners. Jordan was closest to extending the lead when a shot across goal bounced past the visiting keeper, and narrowly wide of the far post.<br><br>Scott replaced Ben midway through the half, and he instantly showed his strength down the left flank, although he lacked support in attack. Robbie and Alex worked tirelessly in the middle, both putting in plenty of running, breaking down Hook attacks and getting the ball forwards.<br><br>A half-time change saw Robbie and Jack rested, allowing Ben to rejoin the attack and Jordan to re-appear in midfield. With Scott and Charlie also on the field, the balance of the side was a little too heavily weighted with strikers, and Pumas took advantage when a flowing move down the right ended with an effort on goal which beat Frasier on his near post.<br><br>Camberley responded by immediately going on the attack, although the ball was not rolling for them in the final third. Then suddenly, a lifeline, when a goal bound effort appeared to strike the hand of a Pumas defender. Several Royals players appealed, and the referee pointed to the spot. Ben grabbed the ball, waving away a number of team-mates who offered to take the kick, before Royals' top scorer stepped up and confidently thumped the ball high into the net to put them back in front.<br><br>A slender one goal lead never looked to be enough, as Hook continued to come forwards. Camberley opened up a two goal cushion with still 15 minutes left when Jordan broke up an attack and moved up to the halfway line with the ball, before unselfishly playing a perfectly weighted through pass. Scott was presented with a clear run on goal, and he waited for the right moment before coolly placing the ball beyond the reach of the onrushing keeper for 3-1.<br><br>Hook reduced the arrears almost straight from kick off. Camberley's defence allowing far too much space inside their penalty area, and a Pumas forward managed to get a shot through which entered the goal via a post. Royals hit a few speculative shots from distance which had the visiting keeper in trouble, and Jordan was a whisker away from clinching it with another long range effort which sailed an inch wide with the keeper nowhere.<br><br>There were only five minutes to hold on, and Hook began to press forwards, creating a number of chances. JJ producing a timely block to save a certain goal, and Frasier coming to the rescue with another outstanding save soon afterwards. With the clock running down, Hook came forwards again, and a cross shot from the left went across goal before it was bundled over the line for a dramatic equaliser.<br>Given the lack of recent matches, nobody could criticise today's efforts. Alex's performance was worthy of Man of the Match, and there were others who had good games in the circumstances. It would be easy to look at today's result as two points lost, however, promotion is still a possibility providing Royals deliver a good performance at Rushmoor this Friday.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>30/03/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Fleet Spurs Blues 3 Camberley Boys Royals 3<br><br>A fixture backlog meant that Royals had to make the trip to Southwood on Sunday this week. With the clocks going forward an hour, the 10:15 kick-off seemed even earlier than usual. No Robbie this week, so Alex was selected to play in midfield alongside Jordan, with Scott upfield with Ben. Jack was captain for the day, and he slotted in at the back with JJ, and the ever reliable Frasier between the posts.<br><br>Royals won the toss and elected to kick-off, which meant defending the muddiest goalmouth we have played on all season. The pitch was very heavy in places due to the overnight rain, and the sunlight failed to dry it out.<br><br>From the off, the home side got the ball down and played a quick passing game, which drew Alex back to help out the defence. Attacking opportunities were limited and mainly breakaways, although the Fleet defence seemed to have the upper hand, forcing Ben into the corners, and the Fleet keeper had little to do in the early stages.<br><br>Four minutes in, and Blues made a run down the right flank. Alex seemed to be in control, although elected to try to turn with the ball, instead of finding the safety of the touchline. The ball was intercepted and played dangerously back into the area, and a low drive found the corner of Frasier's net to hand Fleet a fourth minute lead.<br><br>Royals again gave the Fleet forwards far too much space down the left, and a low effort on goal followed, which was claimed in the mud by Frasier at his near post.<br><br>Despite this let off, Camberley made another defensive mistake. Jack took too long to make a routine clearance, and was closed down as the ball seemed to get stuck on the heavy pitch. Once he was disposessed, Fleets weight in numbers set up a relatively straightforward chance from which they doubled their lead.<br><br>Royals were finally waking up, and a passing move involving Jordan and Scott brought a half chance for Ben, but again he was crowded out. Fleet were still making most of the running, and they failed to make the most of some good positions, either firing off target or straight at Frasier. It only seemed a matter of time before they made one of their chances count, and sure enough, Royals defence failed to close down a Blues forward, who drilled the ball low into the net for 3-0, and a rout looked on the cards.<br><br>Half time gave Camberley the chance to re-group and re-organise, as far too often in the first period, the midfield were caught up the pitch and guilty of not tracking back. A big effort was going to be needed, as well as a little luck if they were to get back into the match, and they were unlucky not to get on the scoresheet within a minute of the restart. Scott's dipping effort from outside the box had the keeper beaten all ends up, before hitting the inside of the right hand post and rolling along the goal line.<br><br>As expected, Fleet had their tails up, and were still creating chances. Frasier was almost single handedly coming to the rescue and pulled off a string of fine saves. One, a great reflex save to tip the ball over, and another when he showed incredible bravery to dive at the feet of a Blues striker, taking a boot in the face in the process.<br><br>Buoyed on by Frasier's exceptional performance, Royals mounted a break which saw Scott race down the left, come inside, and beat the keeper on his near post, and the arrears had been reduced to 3-1. Suddenly, some belief started to return, and Royals were starting to look dangerous coming forwards, and incredibly, Scott struck again with an almost identical effort, although his finish into the far corner was even better. There were ten minutes left, had Camberley enough time to rescue the game?<br><br>The minutes ticked on, and both sides raised their game for the closing stages. Scott, Ben and Jordan all getting forwards and trying their luck, before Alex thumped a 20 yard effort half an inch wide. Then, ninety seconds from full time, Ben found some space in the Blues area for the first time, and his rasping drive was too hot for the the goalkeeper, and hit the back of the net. The whistle went soon afterwards, and somehow, Royals had come from three down to rescue a point.<br><br>What a morning! Camberley didn't show up in the first half, and were backs against the wall for long periods, although they never gave up. Even this late in the season, nothing is certain, and four teams are still battling for the top two places, so this may prove to be a very valuable point indeed. Fleet Spurs Blues can justifiably feel unlucky not to have won, given their half-time lead, and the number of chances they created in the second half. During a season where our forwards have taken a lot of the congratulations, today's victory would never have been possible without Frasier, who had an exceptional game in really difficult conditions. Rightly, Frasier was the Man of the Match, but a special mention to Scott, who scored twice today, and could have had more, especially in the second half.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who made the effort to get today's game played. Of the eight lads who represented Royals, two were carrying knocks, and one was feeling unwell, which makes todays point even more special.<br><br>Thanks also to Andy O for refereeing the second half.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>15/03/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 3 Fleet Spurs Swifts 1<br><br>With Farnborough Sixth Form college closed, Royals penultimate home league fixture was moved to Chobham Road Recreation ground, where Fleet Spurs Swifts were the visitors. Swifts, still challenging near the top of the table were likely to provide tough opposition on a heavy pitch.<br><br>A tactical decision to leave Jordan off for the opening minutes gave Alex the opportunity to try out an unfamiliar midfield role alongside captain for the day, Robbie. Ben was also rested early on, so Charlie and Scott played up front. Jack and JJ were defending in front of Frasier.<br><br>From the off, both sides got the ball down and tried to play positive football. Alex's determination together with Robbie's energy ensured that Royals saw plenty of the ball in the opening minutes, and they almost got off to the perfect start when Scott's run down the left flank ended with a low ball across the area, from which Charlie only just failed to make contact.<br><br>Swifts, with two big, quick midfielders looked dangerous when running with the ball. Jack and JJ were called into action and made some vital interceptions. Fifteen minutes in, Royals rearguard was finally breached, although Frasier was down low to his right to make a fine save, tipping the ball onto the upright. Jack reacted the quickest and cleared the ball to safety.<br><br>The referee blew the whistle for half-time with the game goal-less, although had to gather he players up again when he realised that only 20 of the 25 minutes had been played. The game resumed, and the visitors took the lead with a bizarre goal. A Fleet attack broke down, and Jack cleared the ball, which ricocheted back towards goal off of a Spurs forwards shins. Somehow, the ball evaded Frasiers grasp and crossed the line.<br><br>With the Royals trailing, they took the field for the second half looking to get back on level terms, and the equaliser came within a minute of the restart. Ben took control of the ball at the edge of the area, and took advantage of a positional misjudgement by the Spurs keeper, and found the unguarded net. Royals intelligently played the ball around when coming forwards, and Ben's ball across the area fell for Scott, who made no mistake from close range to give Royals the lead.<br><br>Not content to sit on their slender lead, Royals kept pushing forwards in numbers in search of more goals. Scott and Charlie were both close to adding a third goal, whilst at the other end, Swifts had not given up hope of finding a equaliser of their own. Some good work in defence restricted the visitors to a couple of cross shots which were off target.<br><br>Jack, who had played most of the second half on his own at the back, was rested and Alex and JJ came back on to see the game out. This allowed Jordan and Robbie to get further upfield. With just two minutes to go, Ben's effort on goal was claimed, and then fumbled by the Fleet keeper, allowing Jordan to make the game safe at 3-1.<br><br>The final whistle brought Royals three valuable and well deserved points over a Fleet side, who have given us two good games this season. There were some tough midfield battles, and some fierce tackles, although the game was played in a good spirit throughout, and credit must be given to all players on both sides.<br><br>A few more tough games are ahead, and Royals need to continue their efforts for the last three games. There were some strong performances from Camberley today and most of the boys deserve special mentions. Frasier made one fantastic save in the first half, and showed great character in the second half. Scott, who had been unwell in the week, and played though in some discomfort. His goal was well deserved. Man of the Match was Jack, who defended resolutely, and made many timely clearances.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>01/03/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 5 Cove Panthers 4<br><br>Cove Panthers made the short trip to Farnborough Sixth Form on a bright but breezy morning. A full Royals turnout meant two subs rotating throughout, with Scott and Jack the first changes.<br><br>Panthers were quick out of the blocks, and took the lead within 15 seconds, when a flowing move down the right hand side ended with a low shot which beat Frasier on his near post. The shock woke Royals up, and they forced a couple of early corners, although nobody was on hand to match the quality of Jordan's delivery, and test the visiting keeper.<br><br>Five minutes in and Camberley's pressure eventually paid off. A fine strike on goal from Ben was well saved, and Charlie was first to react, finishing from close range to tie up the score at 1-1.<br><br>The game continued at a frantic pace with both sides taking turns in mounting an attack. It was Cove who regained the lead with a carbon copy of their first, once again a low effort on goal found its way past Frasier at the near post.<br><br>The introduction of Scott created more space on the left, and he and Jordan looked to play in Charlie with measured crosses. With Royals seeing plenty of the ball in the Cove half, the second goal arrived. Jordan's effort on goal went through the legs of a Panthers defender and took a wicked deflection. The dubious goals panel adjudged that there was not enough evidence to take the credit away from the Royals midfielder, for whom the goal is credited.<br><br>With half time approaching, the game turned again. A strong run from a Panthers player saw them work some space in the area. With the Royals defenders backing off, the forward took full advantage of the hesitancy and fired hard into the roof of the net to give the visitors a 3-2 half time lead.<br><br>Kicking down the slope, although into a stiff breeze, Royals were encouraged to play a passsing game in the second half. Scott was making some great runs down the left, and from one cross, Ben was denied at the near post by some brave goalkeeping. Royals forced a series of corners, with Jordan off the field, Ben took over the responsibility. One perfectly flighted ball into the area was met by a flying header, sending the ball into the net - it was a shame that it couldn't have been a Camberley head on the ball, and this one definitely has to go down as an own-goal.<br><br>Royals joy, was short lived. After another attack down the right, JJ was forced into making a clearance which went across the front edge of the penalty area. Cove intercepted the ball and made the chance count, taking the lead for the fourth time in the match.<br><br>Jordan came back on for Robbie, and his strong running with the ball started to open more space for Ben and Scott, who was now given a more attacking role. Ben was sent tumbling on the edge of the area, but Jordan's free kick was scrambled to safety. Soon after, Jack seemed to have equalised when his right foot shot looked to have crossed over the line, but the referee waved play on.<br><br>With only eight minutes remaining on the clock, a Panthers defender handled the ball after being put under pressure. Some discussions between the players followed, before Ben took the ball and placed it on the spot. It proved the right decision, as he confidently dispatched the ball into the net for yet another equaliser.<br><br>To both sides credit, neither had given up hope of scoring again, and as it turned out, there was another goal to come. Five minutes from the end of full time, Ben found enough room in the crowded Cove area, and found the corner of the net despite a desperate attempt from the keeper.<br><br>A tactical change saw Robbie back onto the pitch as Royals looked to protect their lead. The change was good enough to see out the final few tense minutes, until the referee brought an end to a nine goal thriller.<br><br>Robbie was today's man of the match in recognition of the energy and effort displayed. He made a number of telling runs into enemy territory, and some vital tracking back and tackling to help out in defence. Once again, I have to mention Alex's performance, who ran Robbie close for this weeks award. He is adding consistency to his effort and endeavour.<br><br>A nerve racking game for many, and full credit must be given to Cove Panthers for their part. Their coach advises that they have have a number of tough games left before they complete their season, however, on todays display, I'd tip them to do very well in the run-in.<br>Full marks also to Camberley for not throwing in the towel or letting their heads drop. It speaks volumes for their own character that, despite being behind on four separate occasions, they battled on and were rewarded with victory, and three more precious points.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>23/02/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 4 Wey Valley Dragons 0<br><br>Royals were without Scott for the visit of Wey Valley Dragons on Saturday morning. Alex's pace and strength gave him the nod over Jack, and he and JJ started the match in defence, with Jordan and Robbie in midfield. Charlie partnered Ben in attack.<br><br>Dragons, on a good run of form and unbeaten so far in 2008 were defending deeply, and relying on the counter attack. To their credit, they did break out in numbers taking advantage of playing down the slope in the first half, forcing Frasier to bravely dive at the feet of a visiting forward to break up an attack. Soon afterwards, the referee penalised Royals for Alex's backpass inside the area. With the visiting manager vociferous in demanding a penalty kick, the referee correctly adjudged that an indirect free kick should be awarded. The resultant ball across goal was comfortably claimed by Frasier.<br><br>Royals were running at the Dragons, putting them under pressure down the flanks. Charlie's determination won him the ball on the right, and a measured pass found Ben in the area, his effort was wide of the mark. On the left flank, Jordan's typical running and willingness to beat the last man saw him try his luck from distance. After one failed attempt, the next effort from just outside the penalty area found the back of the net to put the Royals in front.<br><br>Royals had further opportunities to increase the lead: Charlie picked up the ball on the edge of his own area after a Dragons attack had broken down, and took the ball over the halfway line. After drawing one defender, he passed through to Ben, who was off target. Another golden opportunity soon after when the Wey Valley keeper made a mess of a goal kick. Ben was first to the ball, but opted for power rather than finesse, and blazed the ball over the crossbar.<br><br>Royals changed formation for the start of the second half, playing three men in midfield supporting Ben in attack. Within a minute, Jack got on the end of a decent cross at the back post and his attempted volley went across goal. The ball was played back to Jordan who deftly placed the ball left footed into the top right hand corner through a crowded penalty area for 2-0.<br><br>Royals dominance in defence, superbly marshalled by Alex allowed most of the second half to be played in the Dragons' half. Charlie was re-introduced to add more firepower in attack, and took up some intelligent positions. He was on the end of a fluent move which included a series of well made passes but failed to make it count when he snatched at his shot.<br><br>Charlie turned provider a few minutes later, when a through ball found Jack in an advanced position. Not sure what to expect next, everyone watched on as Jack's low drive found the corner of the net for his first ever Royals goal.<br><br>Royals fourth goal came from the left boot of Jordan. From just inside the Dragons half he spotted the visiting keeper a few yards off his line. His audacious lob sailed over everybody, including the keeper, and dropped beneath the crossbar to complete a second successive hat-trick.<br><br>Ben's hard work was so far going unrewarded. A surging run took him past one defender, but the second one tripped him on the edge of the area. Jordan took the resultant free kick, and despite being well within his shooting range, he found Charlie at the far post with a well placed cross. Charlie's radar was a little out, and he squandered the opportunity to get on the scoresheet. <br><br>Royals' finished the game by forcing a number of corners, but none of them brought reward, and the game ended in a well deserved 4-0 victory.<br><br>Man of the match today was Jordan - three well taken goals and excellent passing and running in attacking positions. At the back, Alex had another impressive game, his strength, energy and determination make him worthy of a special mention. Charlie showed some aggression and positional awareness, and on another day would have got a goal that his overall performance deserved. It was good to see Jack finally on the scoresheet - we only have one outfield player who has yet to find the oppositions net this season, although there is still time.<br><br>From a coaches perspective, one pleasing note is that the team is beginning to understand the value of passing the ball and finding and creating space. Today's opponents have noticeably improved since our last encounter three months ago, and it proves that as a team, we too have made considerably improvements in many parts of our game. Well done to everybody!<br>Finally, a Happy Birthday to JJ, who turns 9 tomorrow. Best wishes from everyone - I hope you have a memorable day.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>09/02/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 6 Alton United Gladiators 0<br><br>Royals, back to full strength, welcomed back Frasier back into goal for the visit of Alton United Gladiators. Alex looking to continue his recent impressive form at the back alongside Jack. Scott and Jordan worked the midfield looking to supply Charlie and Ben up front.<br><br>From the off, Camberley put the Gladiators under pressure, getting the ball forward early and testing the visiting defence. Jordan was winning plenty of the loose balls in midfield, and driving forwards to the edge of the area, where he was encouraged to shoot. Charlie, Scott and Ben all found space in the box early on, but were kept at bay by some desperate Alton defending.<br><br>Ten minutes in, Royals came close to opening the scoring, after an exchange of passing between Scott and Jordan saw the ball crossed low across goal. Ben brought the ball under control, and his goalbound effort was pushed onto the post and out for a corner.<br><br>Midway into the half, Robbie came on for Scott, and his introduction paid off almost immediately. A strong run from midfield took him out to the left of the Gladiators penalty area, before his excellent low cross inside found Ben, who made no mistake to give Royals a 15th minute lead. Robbie's energy and running was creating Alton problems, and also giving Jordan more room in midfield. Jordan was soon on the scoresheet with another strike from outside the box.<br><br>Camberley continued to attack, forcing a number of corners and coming close to adding to their tally. Gladiators few attacks were comfortably dealt with by Jack, JJ and Frasier.<br><br>Jordan and Ben were rested at the start of the second half, and this coincided with Alton's best period of the game. Royals were playing much deeper, and playing on the break. Despite this, Royals had the best chances to score: Scott making an excellent break down the left before unselfishly playing the ball inside to Charlie, who had taken up an excellent position, unfortunately he rushed his chance and sliced the ball wide with just the keeper to beat. Soon after, Scott was clear through and one on one with Gladiator's last defender, before a well timed tackle delayed the attack long enough for visiting defenders to help clear the danger.<br><br>Ben and Jordan came back on, and it wasn't long before Ben's fierce drive took a deflection on it's way past the keeper to give Camberley a comfortable 3-0 advantage. With 10 minutes still left to play, Jordan ran half the length of the field, past two defender and round the keeper for the pick of the goals.<br><br>Royals were now completely in control, and Scott almost got in on the act when he diverted a cross-cum-shot from Ben narrowly over the bar with the keeper nowhere. With Royals now having two players on a hat-trick, both Jordan and Ben were raining shots in on goal to get to the treble first. This weeks race was won by Jordan, who produced two more quality finishes to grab four of Camberley's final tally of six goals.<br><br>A comfortable day out and an excellent victory which was thoroughly deserved. A number of the boys had excellent games today, and when they pass the ball about, they are a joy to watch. Special mentions today once again to Alex, who is playing his best football since joining the Royals. Scott also had a great game - some strong running complimented some excellent passing in attack, creating a number of goalscoring opportunities. Robbie's presence in midfield had him up for the Man of the Match.... until Jordan's four goals made the decision a formaility<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>02/02/08 NEHYL Div 4<br><br>Ludwig Hurricanes 1 Camberley Boys Royals 8<br><br>After last weeks disappointment, Royals needed to get back to winning ways with an improved performance at Ludwig Leisure. With Frasier still away, Robbie continued in goal, with Alex and JJ in defence. Jordan and Scott were in midfield with Charlie and Ben up front.<br><br>From early on, Royals were given a number of chances from dead balls in and around the Ludwig area, although couldn't test the keeper depite some great delivery into the box.<br><br>Alex and JJ were keeping Hurricanes out, and playing some good early balls forward to keep the pressure on the home side who kept defending well. Scott came close ten minutes in, but his shot across goal went narrowly wide of the far post. <br><br>A tactical move saw Jack come on for Charlie to bolster the midfield, and almost immediately the deadlock was broken. Scott moved down the left flank and delivered a great ball into the box, Ben stuck out a leg and diverted the ball past the keeper to make it 1-0.<br><br>A minute later, Scott played the ball back into the path of Jordan, who let fly across the keeper from the edge of the area, and into the far corner of the net.<br><br>Royals now had their tails up and were looking far more dangerous, although when the third goal arrived five minutes before the interval, players and spectators looked at the match official expecting the goal to be ruled out. The referee, however, deemed that Ben's challenge on the keeper was legal, and as soon as he rolled the ball over the line, the goal was awarded.<br><br>Royals' scoring for the first half was not yet complete, a breakaway from the half way line saw Scott and Ben try and run through on goal, before the ball was taken by Jordan, who advanced into the area and calmly passed the ball wide of the keeper for 4-0.<br><br>With half time looming, a long ball from the Ludwig half bounced over Alex leaving a home striker with a clear run on goal. It looked like the Hurricanes player had taken the ball too far, as Robbie swooped to collect the ball, somehow the ball, striker and Robbie all ended in the net and the goal was awarded.<br><br>The late kick-off, and other family commitments meant that JJ had to leave at half time. Jack moved back into defence with Charlie in a midfield/striker role, and within two minutes of the restart, Royals were extending their lead. Jordan's run into midfield was followed by an excellent through ball which put Ben away. He brought the ball under control and produced a calm and accurate side foot finish to bag another hat-trick.<br><br>Royals were dominating most of the play, although Hurricanes did put had a couple of second half chances, from one, Robbie got fingertips to a goalbound effort tip it onto the post. A goalmouth scramble followed before Jack cleared the danger.<br><br>Charlie had a couple of half chances, and Jordan was shooting from distance, no doubt keen to try to notch a hat-trick, but it was Ben who was in the right place at the right time to add another with ten minutes left, and he scored again soon after, bringing a Ludwig goalkick under control and firing first time back past the keeper for his 5th.<br><br>The scoring was complete 5 minutes from time when Scott, who had a good game, tried to play the ball inside to Ben. The ball ricoched kindly back to him off of a Harriers defender and he steered the ball into the far corner of the net for 8-1.<br><br>Verdict: Much improved performance on last week and a deserved victory. Ben looked sharp again this week and is a danger to any defence at this level. Five goals and good value for Man of the Match. Alex once again showed great determination at the back, and had another good game. Scott and Jordan also worked hard in midfield, and whilst they are both comfortable on the ball, Royals look much more dangerous coming forwards when they play a passing game.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>26/01/08 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 0 Liss Athletic Tigers 2<br><br>With no game in nearly three weeks, Royals were further hampered by the absence of Frasier, who has been their last line of defence for all of the 2007/8 season to date. Robbie kindly volunteered to take the goalkeepers gloves for our home tie against Liss United Tigers - a brave move against a side who had won their previous league match 9-0. JJ and Alex lined up in defence with Jack moving into midfield to partner Jordan. Ben and Scott started in attack.<br><br>Much of the early posession was in the Liss half but the visitors defence was well organised. Royals managed to force a number of corners, although nobody was able to find the decisive touch in front of goal, despite some good delivery into the penalty area. JJ came the closest to finding the net when, following a clearance, he had an effort from the edge of the area. Unluckily his shot was wide of the post.<br><br>Liss made a few forward runs as the half wore on, and Robbie was called on to make a fine save, before a follow up effort went over the crossbar. A couple more attacks were launched and the visitors looked most dangerous when attacking from wide positions<br><br>Royals continued to come forwards, Alex making some great tackles and getting the ball forwards early, birthday boy Scott making some good runs down the flanks, which the Liss defence cleared into touch. Jordan's strong run into the box ended with a shot at goal, but his finish was wide of the left hand post.<br><br>The game turned early in the second half when Robbie's goal kick fell to a Liss player, who advanced into the area and finished low and hard into the corner. Within a minute, the lead was doubled after Robbie made a brave save at the feet of a Liss forward, unfortunately, the loose ball fell kindly to a visiting player, who rolled the ball into the net for 2-0.<br><br>Camberley's efforts to save the game began to lose momentum as heads started to drop, and their forwards but often ran into trouble and eventually ran out of ideas. Ben did have a decent goalbound effort late on, which was saved by the Tiger's keeper. The final whistle ended any slim hope they had of saving the game.<br>Summary: Royals didn't look as sharp as normal today, possibly because of the lack of matches in recent weeks. Our decision making when attacking was poor with players electing to take the ball on themselves in search of personal glory, when a team-mate was in a better position, and often unmarked. Robbie's energy and backtracking was definitely missed in midfield, which put extra pressure on our defence. On the plus side, Alex put in another solid performance, and Charlie was involved in the game and continues to improve each week - between them the two boys appear to be competing for our most improved player. Man of the Match was given to Robbie, who showed great bravery, making a couple of crucial saves.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>05/01/08 NEHYL Div 4<br><br>Hook United Puma's 1 Camberley Boys Royals 2<br><br>Royals returned to action after their Christmas break with an away trip to Robert Mays School, Odiham to take on Hook United Puma's. Hook, a new team, had only played a handful of fixtures so their league position may be a little misleading, having played both Fleet sides, and narrowly losing 5-3 at Ludwig last time out, despite only having six fit players.<br><br>Camberley started the match kicking up the steep slope, although Jordan and Scott were working hard taking the ball forwards at every opportunity, and looking to play in Ben, who was narrowly off target when put through in the opening minutes. Ben did break the deadlock soon afterwards when he turned in the box and squeezed a shot in at the near post from a tight angle.<br><br>Hook came back straight away and got through after Jack mis-timed a tackle. The resultant effort on goal was narrowly wide of the far post. Further pressure from the home side saw an effort come back off a post before Frasier claimed the ball, and the Royals 'keeper was in action again soon afterwards, saving well at the near post.<br><br>Royals were still looking to add to their tally forcing a handful of corners, and Jordan seeing a couple of efforts go wide of the target. The second goal did arrive on the stroke of half time when Scott's effort was on target, and slipped through the Hook keeper's hands. Charlie followed in to bundle the ball over the line to make it 2-0.<br><br>The second half saw Camberley force a series of corners, although unable to find a ball of enough quality to put the home side under pressure. Ben and Jordan both worked chances for themselves, but did not test the keeper. At the other end, Alex and JJ were finding themselves under a fair amount of pressure, as the Puma's stepped up their efforts to get back into the game.<br><br>As the game ebbed and flowed, Royals missed two golden chance to wrap it all up. First, after the keeper parried a goalbound effort from Jordan, the ball fell for Charlie in the area, who hit the ball first time over the bar when an extra touch might have made all the difference. Soon after, Robbie went on a great run which took him into the Puma's area, but his finish lacked power, and was easily saved by the home goalkeeper. These misses looked like may have prove costly, as a minute later, a Hook player was unmarked in front of goal, and finished past Frasier to reduce the arrears.<br><br>A nervous last few minutes were in store, as the home side pressed forwards in search of an equaliser, but the final whistle confirmed Royals seventh win in eight away games.<br><br>Man of the match was given to Alex, who tackled well, and showed a willingness to bring the ball out of defence and make use of it further upfield. Charlie took up some good positions and was good value for his goal, and once again, Frasier made some important saves.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>15/12/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 2 Crookham Rovers Invaders 2<br><br>On another cold morning, the fixture list handed Camberley another tough game, this time against Crookham Rovers Invaders. With Ben away, Scott started the game as Royals' lone striker. Jordan, who had been unwell leading up to the game, was partnered in midfield by Robbie, and an experimental back three of JJ, Jack and Alex but and the ever reliable Frasier between the posts.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the game took a while to warm up, with both sides cancelling each other out. Jack was encouraged to break out of defence and assist in midfield where Jordan was showing his strength, and Robbie was working his socks off on the right of midfield, although the visitors defence proved very difficult to break down. The game began to have the feel of a goalless stalemate about it, Crookham broke at pace and got behind the Royals defence, who were unable to catch up. Fortunately Frasier was able to clear the ball to safety. Despite this let-off, a similar move midway through the first half saw two Crookham forwards clear through on goal, and this time the deadlock was broken.<br><br>Camberley made a tactical substitution, Jack making way for Charlie, who moved up front with Scott, and the more attacking formation started to produce a few more chances, from one of these, Jordan got into the area shot wide of the post with his unfavoured right foot. A couple of minutes later the ball fell onto Jordan's left, and this time he beat the keeper, finding the far corner of the net to equalise.<br><br>Royals had their tails up now, and were having their best spell of the game. An excellent block tackle on the halfway line by Alex, who brought the ball forward and played a great through ball to Scott, before good work from the Invaders' keeper saw off the danger. Almost immediately, however, the vistors broke away again, and after some good passing play found space inside the Camberley area, and regained the lead.<br><br>Half time gave Camberley the chance to regroup, and they immediately began to press forwards to try to save the game. The defence held firm again and chances were few and far between. Charlie had the ball 20 yards from goal, but shot tamely wide when Scott and Jordan were in support and may have been better options. Crookham were hitting back on the break and opened the defence on a couple of occasions, Frasier commanding his area well, and keeping them out.<br><br>Scott and Jordan were working the left side of midfield looking for a way through the Crookham rearguard, and finally their persistance paid off, when Jordan was fed in the area, and he fired his second of the game low past the keeper. Both sides kept coming forwards in search of a winner, and the best chance fell to the Invaders - after some desperate defending, the ball fell to a Rovers striker who sent the ball agonisingly wide when he looked odds on to score.<br><br>The final whistle blew soon after and the game had ended in an entertaining 2-2 draw. Special mentions today to Frasier, who made some vital saves, for Jordan, who scored twice despite being a little off colour, and JJ, who was Camberley's man of the match.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>08/12/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Farnborough Athletic Allstars 3 Camberley Boys Royals 2<br><br>On a day when many other fixtures had already fallen foul of the weather, Royals made the short trip to Farnborough in a top of the table clash played in torrential rain and a bitterly cold cross wind. Camberley's starting line up of Frasier, Jack, JJ, Jordan, Scott, Charlie and Ben, took up their positions on the heavy pitch.<br><br>The opening exchanges were fairly even, Farnborough getting into dangerous positions and stretching Royals defence, and Camberley also seeing a lot of the ball. From one move, Ben saw an effort rebound off the near post following some good play down the left flank. The opening goal arrived on 4 minutes, when Scott picked the ball up on the right of midfield and threaded a pass through to Ben, who shot low and hard to the keeper's left and found the corner of the net.<br><br>The lead was to last barely a minute when a ball in from the left found an All Stars striker at the back post, who immediately levelled the match.<br><br>Play continued from end to end with Jack and JJ needing to concentrate on their positional play, and although Farnborough did get a few efforts in on goal, none of them troubled Frasier. At the other end, Ben had another effort across goal which looked good enough to have restored the Royals lead, unfortunately, the ball came back out off of the far post and was cleared to safety.<br><br>The second half saw the late arriving Alex replace Jack at the back, and the game turned within five minutes of the restart. Ben took a run at the home defence, and skipped past one challenge. As he was bearing down on goal he was brought down inside the box. The referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, however, Ben's penalty was well saved by the home keeper diving to his right.<br><br>The let off spurred the home side on, and they pushed forwards in numbers. Alex unfortunately missed his kick and was caught out of position, and the All Stars attack took full advantage of the mistake to go ahead in the match at 2-1.<br><br>Minutes later, the defence was caught out of position again, allowing another free run at goal. Frasier got down to block the effort, which crept agonisingly under his body and over the line for 3-1.<br><br> To the Royals credit, they kept battling and Ben hit the woodwork for a third time, when an effort from the right side hit the angle of post and crossbar. Scott, however, did reduce the arrears with 10 minutes left, bringing a goal kick under control, closing in on goal and producing a calm clinical finish past the home keeper.<br><br>The final whistle went after only 22 minutes of the second half, cutting short Royals' opportunity to grab a last gasp equaliser, as we had done earlier in the season. Defeat was a little tough on the lads today, who battled hard in conditions which made playing our normal game very difficult. Robbie's non-stop running and energy was worthy of the man-of-the match award, with special mentions to Scott, who made one and scored one, and Ben, who with an ounce more luck, may have scored two or three today<br>Royals credentials will be further tested over the next few weeks when they have a number of hard games coming up<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>01/12/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 7 Ludwig Leisure Hurricanes 2<br><br>Royals squad was bolstered by new signing Scott Waddell, and he fitted into the side perfectly to give them the edge over Ludwig Leisure Hurricanes. The starting line up saw Robbie and Scott in midfield, Ben and Charlie up front, with Jack and Alex the defensive duo in front of Frasier. Jordan and JJ were waiting in the wings for their opportunity to join the action.<br><br>Camberley's passing game gave them an immediate reward in only the second minute of the game when, after some clever forward play, Ben was fouled on the edge on the Hurricanes penalty area. Ben took the resultant free kick, and beat the keeper with a well hit shot to open the scroing.<br><br>Camberley won the ball in midfield straight from the kick off, and the ball was played in to Ben, who worked himself into the area and fired home his second to give Royals a 2-0 lead.<br><br>With barely five minutes on the clock, Ludwig hit straight back, when a long ball over the top saw our defence napping, and the Hurricanes striker clipped the ball past the Frasier as he rushed out of goal, and brought them back into the game at 2-1.<br><br>Royals kept pressing forwards, with Scott linking up play between the midfield and forwards very effectively. He had already played in Ben, whose effort hit the right hand post, before he popped up in the box to meet a cross from the right, and confidently side footed his first Royals goal.<br><br>Moments later, Royals opened up a three goal lead. Scott was again involved, and had an effort on goal blocked. Charlie was the most alert as he brought the loose ball under control and despatched it past the keeper for 4-1.<br><br>With the interval nearing, Ben picked up the ball and wriggled past a defender inside the area, and for the third game in a row, he had completed a first half hat-trick.<br><br>The second half saw Charlie and Scott replaced by Robbie and Jack, this allowed JJ to move forward to join Ben in attack. Ludwig were to score first, however, when another player got behind our back two and fired high into the net for 5-2.<br><br>Jordan was coming forwards at every opportunity, and trying his luck from distance. Partnered in the middle by the hard working Robbie, large parts of the action were seen in and around the visitors penalty area. From one cross, JJ was so close to notching his first ever Camberley goal. He did, however, made amends minutes later, firing Royals' sixth goal of the game with a sweetly struck left foot shot into the corner of the net, to the delight of all the home spectators.<br><br>Jordan wrapped up the scoring, moving into the visitor box and firing a left foot effort across the keeper and into the far corner for 7-2.<br><br>A vastly improved performance for which all players should be equally proud, particularly in the final third. Scott's inclusion promoted a passing game in the opposing half, which created space and a number of chances. The team is getting better each week. We do need to work on the errors at the back if we are to keep the chasing pack away. Two tough games coming up, which everybody should be really looking forward to.<br><br>Man of the Match: Scott Waddell - an impressive debut, great passing and awareness, a goal, and a number of assists. Well done!<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>24/11/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Cove Panthers 1 Camberley Boys Royals 6<br><br>On a bitterly cold morning, Royals made the short trip to Cove after a last minute change of venue made necessary by a waterlogged pitch at Farnborough Sixth Form college.<br><br>Royals started brightly, and as early as the fourth minute, Jordan opened the scoring, firing high into the net from outside the area. The lead was doubled soon afterwards when Robbie kept his nerve and calmly finished off a loose ball inside the Cove box.<br><br>The third arrived when Charlie picked up the ball on the left hand side of the area and delivered the perfect cross from which Ben volleyed home his first of the match. Ben's second was even better, cutting free in the area and thumping a right foot shot across the keeper and into the top left corner for 4-0.<br><br>Cove attacked on the break, hitting a few long balls forward from the back, and came close to getting one back. Frasier remained alert and twice saved the Royals with brave stops, the second after a goalmouth scramble which also saw the ball rebound off of a post.<br><br>Camberley kept going forwards forcing a number of corners. Jack hitting the right hand post after a good delivery into the box from Jordan.<br><br>Ben completed his hat-trick before the end of the first half, shooting low past the Cove keeper at the near post. There was still time for Jordan to come close to another, his dipping free kick from just inside the Cove half went narrowly over the bar.<br><br>Royals seemed to leave their shooting boots behind at half time, and whilst they continued to press forwards and create chances, the Cove goalkeeper was seldom tested, as a series of efforts from Ben, Jordan and Charlie were all wide of the target.<br><br>Cove Panthers, to their credit, continued to play, led by their No 3 who had an impressive game. They scored a deserved consolation goal ten minutes from time when a ball over the top left a Panthers forward a clear run on goal. Frasier came out but was given no chance as the striker made no mistake with the finish. More poor marking at the back saw an effort from a tight angle come back off of our crossbar, however, minutes later Ben got his fourth goal of the game to make th scoreline 6-1.<br><br>With our last effort on goal, Jordan made a great run from midfield, took the ball to the left, and shot powerfully. His goalbound effort hit the keeper on the head and rebounded to safety.<br><br>Man of the Match was Jordan, who was involved at both ends of the field, particularly in the first half, and has scored in four consecutive games from midfield. Robbie also had a great game, and showed good workrate and a willingness to run with the ball. Ben grabbed another four goals - fantastic.<br><br>Special thanks to Susie Harris for arranging to host the game af Cove FC at very short notice, after Farnborough Sixth Form college cancelled our pitch booking on Thursday evening.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>17/11/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Wey Valley Dragons 1 Camberley Boys Royals 6<br><br>Another great away-day performance from the Royals who took control of the match very early on, and were in front inside the first minute. A long ball forward bounced over the heads of the Dragon's defence and found Ben in acres of space in the penalty area. He set himself up and fired high into the net to give Camberley the perfect start. If the first goal was quick, the second wasn't far behind, and it was Ben again who finished at the near post from a tight angle.<br><br>Royals continued to come forwards. Charlie just failing to get the ball under control when well placed, and JJ going close after coming up for a corner. Wey Valley were playing very much on the counter-attack, although they twice forced Frasier into saves as the half wore on.<br><br>When the third goal did arrive on the stroke of half time, it was well worth the wait. Ben picked the ball up five yards outside the area, and unleashed a piledriver which beat the keeper all ends up, and found the top right corner - a fantastic goal, and a great way to complete your first hat-trick.<br><br>When the teams returned after the interval, Wey Valley began to push forwards in search of a goal. The opening exchanges were much closer, although Royals still saw plenty of the ball in the opposition half, with Ben close on a couple of occasions.<br><br>With the Dragons committing players forward, Robbie picked up a loose ball as and attack broke down, he took the ball out of defence, ran half the length of the pitch, and unselfishly played the perfect ball inside to Ben, who made no mistake in grabbing his fourth.<br><br>Jordan got on the scoresheet soon after, after the ball ran into the area to Jack. As the defenders closed him down, he turned and laid the ball back to Jordan, whose shot through a crowd of legs found the net for 5-0.<br><br>Wey Valley Dragons kept coming forward in search of a goal, and were rewarded finally when, after a goalmouth scramble, the ball fell kindly to the number 3, who rolled it into the corner to the delight of the home fans.<br><br>Royals immediately went back on the attack and Ben was put through on goal again, to finish off the scoring at 6-1.<br><br>The defence are looking very tight again today, with Alex, JJ and Frasier all dealt with the Dragon's threat efficiently and effectively. The energy that Robbie provides has been missed in recent weeks, and he had a real impact on the midfield today, allowing Jordan to become involved in more attacking areas. With five goals today, there could be only one Man of the Match - well played Ben!<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>10/11/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 1 Rushmoor Community Spiders 0<br><br>Camberley were down to the bare bones again this week, with Jonathan and Robbie missing from the squad. JJ and Alex continued their defensive partnership wth Jack moving into midfield with Jordan. Ben and Charlie, who had both scored in the previous two games, continued up front.<br><br>The game got off to a slow start with both sides looking to get to grips with the midfield, and produced little in the way of goalmouth activity early on. When Royals did get the ball forward, Ben found himself crowded out by several Rushmoor defenders, and was unable to find room to test the visitors goalkeeper.<br><br>The breakthrough came on 10 minutes. Jack received the ball in the Rushmoor penalty area, and with his back to goal, he laid off the perfect pass for Jordan to run onto and smash a swerving left foot shot from distance, which dipped in under the bar.<br><br>The goal gave the Camberley team a lift, and they pressed forward again and forces a series of corners, but were unable to find the net again. Ben was put through on goal by another good throughball from Jack. His effort was on target and hit well, producing a fine save from the Rushmoor keeper.<br><br>With half time approaching, Alex lost concentration at the back, and a ball over the top found a Rushmoor striker with a clear run at goal. Frasier closed the angle and made a crucial block to clear the danger.<br><br>The second half saw Rushmoor make a tactical change as they pushed more players into attack, looking to level the match. JJ and Alex were having to work tirelessly to keep our lead, and Royals were restricted to playing on the counter attack. From one attack, a cross found a Rushmoor player unmarked on the back post, but with the goal gaping, their effort went wide of the post.<br><br>Camberley had a couple of efforts of their own. Charlie taking an effort early with his unfavoured left foot, but firing wide, just after Ben had wriggled his way into the Rushmoor area, and was denied by a timely last ditch tackle as he was about to pull the trigger.<br><br>As the game approached the final few moments, Rushmoor threw everything at the Royals in an effort to save the game - even bringing their keeper forward for a corner kick. It looked like their efforts would be rewarded when, after a period of pressure, they produced an effort on target. Frasier had to be at his best to be equal to it, and he saved the ball on the line.<br>Royals held on for the last few nervous minutes and the final whistle brought relief to players and parents alike to record their first home league win of the season. Man of the Match was awareded to JJ, with special mentions to Alex, who continues to improve each week, and Frasier, who had much more to do this week, but kept his most important clean sheet of the season so far.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>03/11/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Alton United Gladiators 1 Camberley Boys Royals 4<br><br>Royals were on their travels again, looking to preserve their unbeaten away record. The same seven who featured in our last league game started, meaning that Jack partnered Jordan in midfield. Charlie and Ben formed a two man attack. JJ and Alex were the defensive barrier in front of Frasier.<br><br>From the off, Jordan and Ben combined well down the left flank, but found that finding space in the Gladiators penalty area was not easy, as the home defence held firm. Royals best chance fell to Charlie, who put the ball wide when well placed. Alton showed that they could create chances of their own, and an effort went over Frasier's crossbar after a quick breakaway.<br><br>Despite dominating play, Royals went in at half time a goal behind when a ball was played across the area, and a Gladiators player finished low into the corner as the Camberley defence hesitated.<br><br>The second half fightback began immediately after the restart, when Jordan's long ball put the home defence under pressure. The ball fell kindly for Ben, who made room and found the bottom corner. The Royals were now pressing forward in numbers, and it seemed only a matter of time before they were rewarded with a second goal. Their continued pressure finally told when Jordan's shot from distance had too much power for the keeper, and crossed the line for 2-1.<br><br>Camberley continued to create chances, Charlie produced a clever turn, run and shot which saw the ball go just wide, and Ben had another effort from distance which hit the left hand post. Ben did extend the lead with a typical run and finish to open up a two goal lead.<br><br>Robbie, who had been putting in bag loads of running and effort, had to leave the field with quarter of an hour to go, after picking up a knock. A re-shuffle saw JJ moving to the right side of midfield, and the change almost paid dividends when the ball fell to him in the area. His effort was on target, but was straight at the keeper.<br><br>Further Royals pressure put the game beyond Alton. Ben, looking hungry to add to his tally, saw an effort cannon back off the post. Charlie was the most alert, picking up the rebound and driving past the keeper and into the corner for 4-1.<br><br>Ben had a couple of further chances to complete his hat-trick, twice narrowly wide when put through on goal. Surely it is only a matter of time before he notches his first treble.<br><br>Special mentions today for Ben, who is a constant danger, for Charlie, who had one of his better games, and Jordan, who once again bossed the midfield. Alex Flaherty was awarded man of the match for the amount of effort he put in - his performances are improving each week, and he has thrown his hat in the ring for our most improved player of the season so far.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>20/10/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Liss Athletic Tigers 0 Camberley Boys Royals 3<br><br>Royals went into today's game on the back of consecutive defeats and were without both Robbie and Jonathan. Jack moved from his usual defensive duties to partner Jordan in midfield, and Alex had the opportunity for a full game in central defence alongside JJ.<br><br>A clever piece of thinking almost gave Camberley an early lead, when Jordan controlled a goal kick, and hit a great effort from distance which troubled the keeper, before it was eventually scrambled to safety.<br><br>Camberley did take the lead soon aftwards when Ben was put through on goal by Jack, and he confidently drove the ball past the keeper from the edge of the penalty area.<br><br>Another attack soon after left Jack in front of goal with only the keeper to beat. With it looking easier to score, Jack's effort looped agonisingly over the crossbar.<br><br>Ten minutes into the second half, Camberley extended their lead when a cross from Ben Kirby was excellently finished on the volley by Charlie Trueman. Charlie had an excellent opportunity to put the game beyond the reach of Liss Athletic, but dragged his shot wode of the post with the keeper to beat.<br><br>Camberley's third goal was created from a great through ball by Jordan, putting Ben in the clear to run into the Liss area, and finish powerfully at the near post.<br><br>Ben had a great chance to complete his hat-trick and was only denied by a great block by the home keeper.<br><br>Camberley continued to create chances until the final whistle: a shot on the turn from Charlie sailed narrowly wide, and Jack meeting Jordan's corner at the back post, but was narrowly off target.<br><br>The final whistle went, Royals had kept a clean sheet for the first time this season. The defence was marshalled superbly by JJ, who was as steady as ever, and Alex, who had a great game. Frasier behind them cleared any danger as the home side were restricted to just a couple of efforts on goal.<br><br>All the players had exceptional games, with bags of effort and thoroughly deserved their victory. Jordan Oxford was Man of the Match, although in truth, it could have gone to a number of players.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>13/10/07 NEHYL U9 Div 4<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals 1 Fleet Spurs Blues 2<br><br>Royals returned to league action and were handed a fixture again Fleet Spurs Blues who, until last week, had been competing in NEHYL Division Three. Camberley took a while to adjust to the pace and pattern of the game, maybe showing a lack of confidence after last weeks cup defeat, allowing Fleet to take full advantage, running through unchallenged to open the scoring after Alex was caught out of position inside the opening five minutes.<br><br>A few moments later, Frasier dived bravely at the feet of a Fleet striker to prevent the visitors extending their lead, taking a nasty knock on the leg in the process. He carried on for several minutes when it was clear that he needed to come off the field of play for medical treatment, with Robbie taking over in goal for the next ten minutes.<br><br>Robbie kept Fleet out, and Alex recovered well from his earlier mis-hap, making some vital challenges at the back, helped out by Jack and the ever dependable JJ. With Frasier fit enough to continue, Robbie was allowed back into his normal midfield role, and linked well with Jordan to provide service to Ben, who saw an effort rebound off of a post despite having several Fleet defenders at his heels.<br><br>Ben was finally rewarded for his hard graft when he was on hand to finish a move from close range after an excellent cross from Jordan. He almost added to this a minute later when Jordan put him through on goal. Shaking aside the challenges of two defenders, Ben produced an excellent strike on goal, which the keeper parried onto the frame of the goal before smothering the ball.<br><br>Royals had their tails up, and most of the second period saw us camped in the Fleet half. It only seemed a matter of time before we broke through again. Ben, Jonathan and Jordan all had efforts on goal, but each time our efforts came to nought. Fleet scored what turned out to be the winner five minutes from the end, when a Fleet midfielder got into out penalty area, made room and fired low past Frasier for 2-1.<br><br>Royals continued to press forward in search of an equaliser, but ran out of time. With a little more luck, we may have come out of the game with something, and defeat was a little hard on the boys today.<br>Man of the Match was awarded to Robbie Sheret, who ran tirelessly all game, making in impact in both penalty areas, not to mention keeping a clean sheet for his stint in goal. Other good performances included JJ, Jordan and Jonathan, whilst up front, Ben was a real handful for the Fleet defence throughout.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>06/10/07 NEHYL League Cup<br><br>Camberley Boys Royals  0    Crookham Rovers Raiders 9<br><br>Royals can count themselves a little unfortunate, as their reward for knocking out third division Ludwig Corinthians was a home tie against Crookham Rovers Raiders, unbeaten in the Premier division, and likely to provide the toughest opposition of any will have to play all season. <br><br>The visitors started brightly, passing and moving effectively and creating space in our half, Jack and JJ blocking and tackling and our midfield forced to play deep in our half.

Our objective in the second half was to stop the flow of goals.
